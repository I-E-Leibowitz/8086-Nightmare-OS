# 8086-Nightmare-OS
An 8086 OS developed entirely from scratch, for educational purposes. Looking back, this is a probably a bad idea.

## Design
The kernel.asm file is devided into three distinct sections: </br>
* Code section - contains the code and function calls that run the os.
* Data section - contains variables used throughout the running of the kernel.
* Function section - Contains the functions called from the code.

## Aspirations
At the end of the day, my goal is to have a functional 8086 OS that could do a few basic functions. </br>
In the future, I might try to make it compatible with DOS, but that is a very lofty goal that most likely will not be accomplished.
